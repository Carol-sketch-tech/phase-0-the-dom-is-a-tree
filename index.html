 <!-- computer science version of a Tree.
  the DOM acts like a tree.
  the root of a tree is usually used to refer to  the top of a DOM.
  and the leaves being the most nested html elements.
   the DOM is like a tree upside down. -->


   <!-- The DOM 
     the DOM begins at <html>
        <html> has subtrees <head> and <body>.
             -->

    <!-- finding html elements
     n/b metadata for a node is class and id attributes.
     the id and class attribute that make an elements metadata are useful in accessing a node 
     the more specific the metadata the easier it is to find and retrive an elemnt in DOM
     -->


     <!--  FINDING A NODE 
       methods that are used to find nodes either directly or in stages courtesy of the document obect. 
       these are 
       1. getElementByID()
       2.getElementByClassName()
       3. getElementByTagName()
       these are listed in the order of most to least specific.
        -->

        <!-- document.getElementByID()
         this is the quickest way to access a node but we should know a specific piece of information -its ID
         this method can only return one element since CSS ids are expected to be unique -->


         <!-- Finding a node without knowing anything about it 
          
         this is used when we dont have an id or a class name to use to find an element.
          mix of different methids can be used to try and accomplish a goal take for instancce changing the contents of a 
          cartain node.
